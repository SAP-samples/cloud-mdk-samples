## Key Highlights

* Using the Selection feature to allow end-user to select multiple sales order items and perform deletion on those items
* Using the Context Menu feature to allow end-user to move each sales order item from one state to another
* Disclaimer: Android only support 1 context menu on each side due the Material Design guideline, while iOS and Web support multiple items, so, you should design your app accordingly if you are planning to support both multiple platforms. In this sample project we show multiple context menu items on swipe in iOS and only 1 context menu item in Android purely for demonstration purposes only.
