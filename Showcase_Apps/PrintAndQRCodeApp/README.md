## Setup Instructions

This showcase application requires that you create your own client in order to explore the application.  

The `printapp.mdkproject` folder contains the MDK client configuration to add the external plugins to the client but does not contain the application metadata.  It is assumed that you will load and deploy the metadata to Mobile Services from an MDK Editor.

For a more detailed information on the setup for MDK development please see the following tutorial.
