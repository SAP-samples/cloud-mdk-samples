# SAP Mobile Development Kit Samples

## Welcome to the Mobile Development Kit (MDK) Samples Repository!

The samples provided in this repository are targeted at intermediate to experienced MDK users and are intended to showcase some of the how-to topics that come up in discussions with customers.  We may also provide more full featured sample applications that demonstrate the capabilities of the MDK.

Some samples may be provided more as self contained demonstrations rather than full fledged applcations to showcase a particular topic.  Some samples may also include a **Mobile OData Service** Project or **CAP** Project that will provide the backend data for use in the samples.

If you are new to using the MDK, we highly recommend visiting the Mobile Development Kit page on the [SAP Developers site](https://developers.sap.com/topics/mobile-development-kit.html) and going through the tutorials to get familiar with the basics of MDK before trying to work with the samples in this repository.

### Requirements
The included resources depend on availability of an SAP Cloud Platform account. To use the resources you will need the following:
1. An SAP Cloud Platform account. Users who don't have an account can register for a free trial account.
	See [Sign up for a free trial account on SAP Cloud Platform](https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).

1. Some of the resources connect to the **Sample OData Service** that is part of SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services cockpit based on ESPM model (Enterprise Sales & Procurement Model) and is available for developers to use during development and testing. The sample OData service also lets you evaluate how delta tokens are handled in your test application. This service is specific to an SCP account.

1. Some of the resources connect to a **Mobile OData Service** backend. Use of these backends will require Quota within your SAP Cloud Platform account. Before attempting to run these backends, please ensure you have appropriate quota available.

1. The Mobile Development Kit SDK environment. Users can download the Mobile Development Kit SDK from the SAP Software Downloads center or the latest version is available on the [SAP Developers site](https://developers.sap.com/trials-downloads.html?search=Mobile%20development%20kit).  Please be sure to run the MDK Dependency Installer within the MDK SDK to ensure your environment is setup before trying to create an MDK client using the samples in this repository.
